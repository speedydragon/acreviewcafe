<p>
    Ezio is the main character of “Assassin’s Creed 2“,  “Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood“, and “Assassin’s Creed Revelations.” These three games in the franchise follow Ezio from young adulthood all the way to old age. But first, back story. Ezio is the eldest son of a wealthy family.
</p>
<p>    
    His father and brother are eventually hanged because of an evil political plot. Ezio then gets his father’s old assassin’s gear and hunt down his father and brother’s killers. Ezio joins his uncle Mario in his villa and over time becomes a professional assassin and joins the assassin’s order.
</p>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="Assassin's_Creed2.jpg" alt="">
<p>
    At the start of “Assassin’s Creed 2” , Ezio is only in his early twenties and is a very care free guy. He’s got a happy and rich family, he gets any woman he wants, he runs around the city of Firenze without any rules. Things are good. His father and brother’s deaths quickly throws his life into turmoil. Without any real training, he had to defend himself from guards. His inexperience shows in the cutscene and dialogue, but when the fight starts, that isn’t the case.
</p>
<p>
    This occurs a lot in the game. Ezio is young and not well taught in fighting, but he continues to be super ninja lord with a sword much like Altair. He is a fit man and would often run around town parkouring, so that aspect of him makes sense. He would be strong and agile, but skill with a sword was something that he was never taught.</p>
<p>
    Without this proper training, you can still hack through fools like paper. The game tries to make Ezio seem inexperienced by feeding you abilities, but it doesn’t work that well. The abilities come pretty fast and they are minor things like, “So, now you can disarm.” Basically, the “Assassin’s Creed” power fantasy makes Ezios inexperience and youth kind of disappear.
</p>
<P>
    There is another issue I have with Ezio that the game mechanics indirectly create.
</P><br>
<h3>Assassin’s Creed: Brotherhood</h3>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="Eziobrotherhood1.jpg" alt="Ezio Brotherhood" title="Ezio in Brotherhood">
<P>When Ezio completes his first assassination, it is a very extreme and emotional part. Ezio is freaked out over having killed his first man but he is also filled with elation. He starts screaming out at the crowd of people, “I am Ezio Auditore!” and proclaiming himself to be important. All this reaction is supposed to relate to the time when Ezio has first claimed blood.</P>
<p>He is no longer a simple and innocent young man. However, this moment is kind of ruined because you slaughtered fifty guards on the way to this mission. You can murder whoever you please freely in between roaming around. You might have to even climb a couple buildings hundreds of feet up in the air. You are supposed to be new this game of being assassin, but Ezio kills and jumps around like an old pro. This problem also occurred in a similar way in “Far Cry 3”, which was also made by Ubisoft. It seems like Ubisoft likes this idea of learning along with the game character, but they don’t seem to get it right.</P>
<P style="color: #000080;font-family: georgia, times;font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;text-align: justify;font-style: italic;">I do have a lot of things I do enjoy about Ezio, though.</P>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="Eziobrotherhood2.jpg" alt="Ezio Brotherhood 2" title="Ezio in Brotherhood">
<p>To start things off, Ezio is just cool. He is the kind of guy that boys look up to thinking, “I wanna be that awesome!” He is strong, fast, smooth with the ladies, good with a sword, all the testosterone filled goodness you could ever want. Of course, there are a ton of cool main characters like Ezio, both male and female, but Ezio adds a little extra to the roll. He is so cocky and yet loveable at the same time.</p>
<p>He will brag about his sword skill and then help an old guy buy some fruit. He is suave but gentle, smooth but loving to family and friends. He is just a very likable and happy guy, but when the killing needs to be done he takes care of the job. You think you would hate him and his cocky attitude and real Italian persona. He’s the stereotypical kind of loaded Italian playboy. As you play the game, though, you find out there is more to him then that initial behavior. My favorite part about Ezio however, is his great growth through his three games.</p>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="Eziobrotherhood3.jpg" alt="Ezio Brotherhood" title="Ezio in Brotherhood">
<p>Now, yes, it is kind of unfair to have three games to grow as a character but it happens sometimes. With most characters, you look at how they do through one game, but I think the three game dynamic with Ezio is very interesting. In “Assassin’s Creed 2”, Ezio is very driven by revenge and is an angry young man. He wants blood, and his early tastes of it get him elated and wanting more. He enjoys the feeling of strength and control his weapons and skill give him.</p>
<p>Once you get your revenge, though, Ezio learns a lot of life changing things. He learns of powers greater than him and that revenge did very little to fix things. Once the events of “Assassin’s Creed Brotherhood” start rolling, Ezio is wrapped up in much more important events. Ezio is older now, and although is still going strong with being an assassin, he is wiser now. His drive is no longer revenge, and he does not kill with as much crazed feeling, but with more calculated reasoning. He goes after this with a strategy in mind.</p>
<h3>Assassin’s Creed II</h3>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="Ezio22.jpg" alt="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed II" title="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed II">
<p>His age does not slow him down at all, he is still going strong with the same cocky suaveness as when he was younger. Once you get to “Assassin’s Creed Revelations”, Ezio is very old. He has been through many journeys and has abandoned his family and home for a greater purpose. In his old age, Ezio is very smart and does nothing without methodical thought. He also no longer revels in the thrill of battle, and although he still kills, it is now very much out of necessity. He wants to stop doing this, but he knows he must continue. His drastic difference from his youthful vigor really shows the wear and tear that being an assassin does to him.</p>
<P>Now for the verdict of Ezio, the great assassin. Ezio gets Good. I do have problems with some of the ways that Ezio discovers things. These problems though mostly occur because of the nature of the game’s mechanics so I can get over them. I think Ezio is a very good assassin character and one of the best Ubisoft has done. I am no longer a big fan of the series, but I think the first game to “Brotherhood” were the three best in the series and are worth playing.</P>
<P>Out running errands for his father, Ezio is not home when his father and two brothers are arrested and later publicly hanged. Ezio, following his father's final advice, finds his Assassin tools and flees the city with his mother and sister to his uncle Mario's estate in Monteriggioni.</P>
<p>Mario assists Ezio in discovering the people behind the conspiracy and trains him. While exacting revenge on the Pazzi family, Ezio discovers that more people from outside Florence are involved.The search for those responsible leads Ezio from Florence to San Gimignano, Forlì, Venice, and eventually Rome.</p>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="Ezio2.jpeg" alt="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed II" title="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed II">
<p>As he identifies and assassinates more and more political figures, Ezio also gains several allies, including Niccolò Machiavelli, Caterina Sforza, and Leonardo da Vinci. These allies partly train Ezio into an Assassin and guide him on his quest. Eventually, the conspiracy leads to the mastermind behind the plot: Rodrigo Borgia, Grand Master of the Italian Templars. He sought to find the Apple of Eden a powerful ancient artifact known as a Piece of Eden which lays in Florence.</p>
<P>Ezio finds Borgia in possession of the Apple and learns that Borgia believes himself to be "the Prophet", who will lead the Templars to a fabled "Vault". Ezio is able to confront Borgia with the help of his allies and recover the Apple of Eden, but Borgia flees before he can be killed. Ezio's allies reveal they are all Assassins and believe Ezio to be the true Prophet, allowing him to join their ranks.</p>
<h3>Assassin’s Creed: Revelations</h3>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="EzioRevelations1.jpg" alt="Ezio in Revelations" title="Ezio in Assassin's Creed Revelations">
<p>After the events of Brotherhood, Ezio discovers a letter left behind by his father that talks about a hidden library full of vast knowledge underneath Masyaf Castle, left there by the legendary Assassin Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, setting the events of Assassin's Creed: Revelations into motion. Arriving at Masyaf in early 1511, Ezio is ambushed by Templars who occupy the fortress, also searching for Altaïr's library. After escaping capture and assassinating the Templar captain, Ezio recovers the journal of Niccolò Polo, which tells of five seals hidden in Constantinople that will open the door to Altaïr's library.</p>
<p>Arriving in Constantinople, Ezio begins his search for the seals, while helping the local Assassin's Guild, led by Yusuf Tazim, to overthrow Byzantine Templar control. Over time, Ezio succeeds in eradicating Templar influence and resubjugating the city to the rule of the family of Prince Suleiman.</p>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="EzioRevelations2.webp" alt="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed Revelations" title="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed Revelations">
<p>Ezio recovers four of the five keys with the help of historian and book collector Sofia Sartor. He then travels to an underground city in Cappadocia, the Templar base of operations. After assassinating the Templar leader Manuel Palaiologos and recovering the final key, it is revealed that Prince Suleiman's uncle Prince Ahmet has been secretly leading the Byzantine Templars and wishes to open Altaïr's library for himself.</p>
<p>After Ezio refuses to hand over the keys, Ahmet threatens to harm Sofia and sails off, leaving Ezio in Cappadocia. Upon returning to Constantinople, Ezio finds that Sofia has been kidnapped by Ahmet and Yusuf has been murdered to force Ezio to reveal the key's whereabouts.</p>
<img style="width: 730px;margin-left: 135px;border: black 0.5px solid;" src="EzioRevelations3.jpg" alt="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed Revelations" title="Ezio in Assassin’s Creed Revelations">
<p>Ezio ultimately saves Sofia. He then engages in a chase with Ahmet and eventually recovers the keys from the latter. A returning sultan Selim I kills Ahmet and thanks Ezio for saving his son and country, but at the same time orders him to leave the Ottoman Empire and never return. Ezio and Sofia make their way back to Masyaf and open the library, where Ezio finds Altaïr's corpse. The entire purpose of the library was to convey another message to Ezio's descendant, Desmond Miles, through another Apple of Eden. An aged Ezio decides that he has seen enough violence and mystery for one life, and leaves the Apple of Eden behind.</p>
<p>Borgia, and their French general ally, the Baron de Valois, and incapacitated Lucrezia Borgia, leaving their power base in disarray. Cesare, in a fit of rage, kills his father and begins losing control over the city. After retrieving the Apple, Ezio uses its power to destroy what is left of Cesare's army and allies. By the end of 1503, Borgia control over the city is completely broken and Cesare is arrested by the new Pope, Julius II, escaping some time later.</p>
<p>Ezio rejects the Apple of Eden and hides it below the Colosseum in the Temple of Juno. In 1507, Ezio travels to Spain and catches up with Cesare at the siege of Viana Castle. Ultimately defeated by Ezio, an indignant Cesare Borgia is thrown off the castle walls to his death.</p>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>Initial reception for Ezio as a character was positive. Gamesradar characterized him as an "ass-kicking, morally ambiguous superhero" and noted that he had a livelier and more charming personality then his predecessor Altaïr, with his personal growth being a central aspect of the narrative.Will Tutle of GameSpy also noted Ezio's growth and contrast to Altaïr as his strongest features, stating that while he was an unlikeable womanizer at first, he was later hoping he would "get his revenge and uncover the truth".In contrast, Gamespot's Kevin VanOrd called Ezio "terrific" and "instantly likeable", while praising him as a more realized character then Altair.</p> 
<p>his review of Revelations, VanOrd lauded the developers for reflecting Ezio's age and weariness throughout the game, as well as highlighting his role as a mentor.Matt Miller of GameInformer stated that by Revelations, Ezio has grown from a boy seeking revenge to a man seeking wisdom, as well as a "venerable mentor", which was made a central aspect of his character.</p>
