<hr style="border-top:rgb(246, 193, 95) 3px solid;margin-top:25px;">

<p>Oh, Assassin's Creed! The game series that has become very ridiculous today! Want to know why? Abnormal elements in the game are rampant.The main story of the game is weak 
    And Ubisoft does not care about the opinion of its fans.The game is filled with additional features and elements that just want to make the game look glamorous.
    Many and uncontrollable bugs that sometimes upset the gamer.But this was not always the case!Once upon a time, the Asasin Creed game series opened the first letter among the games of the world
    And had fierce competition with the GTA game series.The first spark of this series was struck by <span style="font-family: georgia, times;font-style: italic;color: #000080;font-weight: bolder;">Assassin's Creed I</span> game.
</p>
<p>So let's begin introducing this fascinating game :</p><br><br>
<img style="height: 400px;width: 740px; margin-left: 124px;border: 0.5px black solid" src="firstpicture.jpeg" alt="altair in front of the gate" title="Assassin's Creed I: Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad"><br><br>
<h2 style="color: darkred;">The general process of the game:</h2>
<p>
    Assassin's Creed I is a third-person game with an open world environment.The main objective of the game is that Altaïr must kill 9 enemy leaders on the orders of his boss, Al Mualim.</p>
<p>
    To kill and assassinate those 9 people, Altaïr must do one of the following four tasks according to the game request.In other words: the gameplay of Asasin Creed 1 is one of the four main parts of Pick Pocketing, Eavesdropping, Interrogation, Informers Mission.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;">
    Each of the missions is fully described below:
</p><br>
<h3>Pick Pocketing</h3>
<img style="width: 750px;margin-left: 124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="pickpocket.png" alt="pick pocketing" title="Altaïr pick pocketing">
<p>
    In Asasin Creed 1, you have to look for someone who has information about your target.It may have a map or handwriting with important information on it.In that case, you have to approach him secretly and in the right position, push a button to pick his pocket.
</p>    
<p>
    Of course, be careful not to do this clumsily, Because the person notices and informs the soldiers and causes you trouble.
</p>
<h3>Eavesdropping</h3>
<img style="width: 750px;margin-left: 124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="Eavesdropping.jpg" alt="Altaïr Eavesdropping.png" title="Altaïr Eavesdropping">
<p>
    In Assassin's Creed 1, sometimes two city's people have information about your <i>target</i>.They meet each other by chance in the city and start talking.You need to be present when the conversation is going to begin and listen to them. 
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;color:#000080;font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;text-align: justify;font-family: jeorjia times;">
    Of course, this will not be easy!Why?
</p>
<ol>
    <li>Well, first of all, you have to keep your distance from the target you are pursuing.Otherwise, the target will be suspicious of you and will no longer go to the meeting place.</li>
    <li>and the second reason is that during the conversation, if you do not have a good distance, you can not hear the conversation.</li>
    <li>also, if you get too close to them, they will end the conversation.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Interrogation</h3>
<img style="width:750px;margin-left:124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="Interrogation.jpg" alt="Interrogation 1" title="Interrogation Picture">

<p>
    It can be said that one of the most interesting missions in Assassin’s Creed 1 is <i>Interrogation</i>.You have a simple task ahead of you in this mission.You must first go to the place where the person in question is.Then you have to wait a while for the people to gather and he will start his sharp speech.By doing so, he intends to incite people to take certain actions.
</p>
<p>    
    Well, this person is so stupid that he can not draw such a big plan alone.So it was definitely hired by someone and that person is definitely your target.
</p>
<p>    
    At the end of the speech, you should follow him to reach a secluded place.Then you have to beat him as much as you can to confess who he took the order from.Of course, be careful not to kill him! Because <i>the dead person can not give you information.</i>
</p>
<h3>Informers Mission</h3>
<img style="width: 750px;margin-left: 124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="Informers_Mission.jpg" alt="Informers_Mission" title=" Informers Mission">
<p>
    In this mission, you entrust yourself to someone who has information and do his work.There is a lot of variety in this. One of them is to defend a certain person.In this case, you must escort him so that soldiers and enemies can not harm him.
</p>
<p>    
    Then when you reach the desired location, the mission is over and you must return to the original person.Finally, he tells you the information you want and leaves it to you.One thing you should know about this mission is that you should not die as a protected person in any case Otherwise, the mission will be ruined.
</p>
<p style="font-style: italic;color:#000080;font-size: 18px;line-height: 24px;text-align: justify;font-family: jeorjia times;">
    So far, we have been talking about the information phase in the game Assassin's Creed 1.Now we enter the assassination phase:
</p>
<h3>Assassination Mission</h3>
<img style="width:750px;margin-left:124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="assassination.jpg" alt="Assassination" title="Altaïr Assassination Picture">
<p>
    This is the main part of the game.After receiving the information, you should go to a point called View Point and see the whole city.After this you will find the hiding place of your target.Then you have to go to the target and kill him.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, this is not an easy task, because he may run away from you or his soldiers may attack you.After you kill him, you infect the fairy with his blood and return to the chief of the Assassins in the city.He tells you that your mission is over.In this case, you should return to Masyaf Castle and go to the teacher and take the next goal from him.And do the above steps again.
</p>
<p>
    Of course, the gameplay includes other items such as Glitch, Eagle Vision and main character situations.It is recommended that you discover them yourself.
</p>
<h3>Graphics</h3>
<img style="width:750px;margin-left:124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="Graphic.jpg" alt="Graphic Picture" title="Graphic picture">
<P>Perhaps it can be said that the weakest part of Assassin's Creed 1 game is its graphics.The bad thing about Assassin's Creed 1 is that everything is repetitive. Of course, this is acceptable given the year of release.</p><p>The intercity transmission system is very normal. First you have to get on a horse and go to the road of your desired city. When you enter the main road, the camera turns away from you and turns white for a moment. Then it appears near the desired city. Of course, the city tour system is good and can entertain you.</p><p>If you want to climb the door and the wall like a spider in the city, people will look at you in a strange way. They also say under their breath: <i>What is wrong with this madman?!</i> If you want to run in the city and hit people? They insult you and pass you by.Also in this case, if you are fast and hit people, they will fall to the ground.</p><p>But the combat system is very well designed. Unlike other versions, in Assassin's Creed 1 you can not use Hayden Blade to fight. The combat system is designed in such a way that you have to react more quickly. It is great and shows you from above to have a full view of your enemies.
    In general, the game graphics are average, down to the bottom.<strong style="color: #000080;font-style: italic;"> Of course, if we compare them with current games.</strong>
</P>
<h3>Gameplay</h3>
<img style="width:750px;margin-left:124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="gameplay.jpg" alt="gameplay" title="Gameplay">
<p>The story of Asasin Creed 1 game is its strong point. The story of the game has a lot to do with its reality. The story of the game takes place in parallel between the present and the time of the Crusades. Miles on a night on his way home that is stolen by people.
    They work for a company called Abstergo. Abstergo intends to use their genetics to obtain an object called the Piece of Eden.</p><p> Abstergo intends to establish world peace by finding that object. Eden must follow the story of a character named Al-Ta'ir Ibn Lahad. In the meantime, Desmond is one of the descendants of Al-Ta'ir, and for this purpose, Abstergo uses him to view the story of Al-Ta'ir's life using genetic memory. We are leaving. When Desmond was not born at all: the Third Crusade.
    You are Al-Ta'ir Ibn Lahad (the bird of no one's child) and you must carry out an important spy on the orders of your teacher.</p>
<p>You go to the temple with the other 3 Asasins. There you see the leader of your opposition group, the Knights Templar. He is killed and the other two Asasins return to Musayyaf. The lost reputation:
Al-Muallem punishes him for Al-Ta'ir's mistake and dismisses him to the lowest rank of the fundamentalists. The story of assassin's creed 1 is very surprising. So wait for many surprises!
</p>
<h3>Location Of The game</h3>
<img style="width:750px;margin-left:124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="location.jpg" alt="Location:Al-Aqsa Mosque" title="Location:Al-Aqsa Mosque">
<img style="width:750px;margin-left:124px;border: 0.5px black solid;" src="location2.jpg" alt="Location:Al-Aqsa Mosque" title="Location:Al-Aqsa Mosque">
<p>The first game, named Assassin's Creed, takes place in the Holy Land during the Crusades. The player character is Altaïr Ibn-La'Ahad, living through the memories of 21st century assassin Desmond Miles.</p>
<p>In general, Altaïr assassinates the following people in the following cities:</p>
<ol style="font-size:15px;" type="i">
    <li>Tamir from Damascus <i class="AltairA" style="margin-left: 124px;">(Farsi: تمیر در دمشق)</i></li>
    <li>Garnier from Acre,Israel <i class="AltairA" style="margin-left: 107px;">(Farsi: گارنیر در عکا،اسرائیل)</i></li>

    <li>Abu'l Nuqoud from Damascus <i class="AltairA" style="margin-left: 58px;">(Farsi: ابوالنقود در دمشق)</i></li>

    <li>Robert De Sable from Jerusalem <i class="AltairA" style="margin-left: 31px;">(Farsi: رابرت دی سابله در اورشلیم)</i></li>
</ol>
<h3>Other game tips</h3>
<P>The game's music is not bad, but it can not appear as it should. The game's artistic graphics are also normal and can entertain the player for a short time. The natural environments are relatively well designed and beautiful. Unfortunately, the game's side characters are very similar. They are each other and this makes the player bored. Soldiers and other basics are no exception to this rule. Of course, the main characters of the game are beautifully designed and this can be encouraging.
    In general, we are not dealing with interesting artistic graphics. Of course, if we want to compare them with today's works!</P>
<h4>Swimming is prohibited!</h4>
<P>The gameplay of Asasin Creed 1 was interesting, but the point was that the bird could not swim in the water. This is very strange from the point of view! Because unless a professional killer can do a normal swim. Let's ask Ubisoft about this!</P>
<h4>Laughter without laughter!</h4>
<p>
    Although Altair is one of the most popular fictional characters, he is very serious. During the game, he does not smile even once. Laugh, man! The world is not more than two days, Altair!
</p>
<h4>What about the crossbow?!</h4>
<p>In the trailer for Assassin's Creed 1, there was a small crossbow behind the bird and it was used. But in the main game, we noticed that this crossbow no longer exists. Ubisoft announced that the bow did not correspond to the time of the Crusades. Yes, Ubisoft has done that!</p>
